# Pathfinder Spell DB

This was created for my own personal use - if you have some fun with it that's great!

It allows you to search & find spells and powers across different classes quickly and easily.

# Installing

Just go to the [Latest Release](https://github.com/fyjham-ts/Pathfinder-SpellDB/releases/latest) page and download the setup executable. This will install the application.

## Unrecognised App Warnings?

You may get a warning installing from Windows that the Publisher is unknown. This is simply because I haven't paid money for a code signing certificate for a hobby project. You'll have to ignore the warning to install. The full source code is all here I'm hiding nothing.

# Credit
[Paizo](http://www.paizo.com) as the makers of Pathfinder are ultimately the source of all the information in this application.

Spell data originally sourced from [PF2e Spell Finder](https://github.com/spellfinder/spells) - though I've made some additions. Much respect to the original app, I just wanted a stand-alone offline app. Without his work on the spell data I'd never have made this.

Random NPC generation based heavily on code from [dndGenerator](https://github.com/cellule/dndGenerator/) - with modification for Pathfinder & removing a few dependencies I didn't want to inherit.

Also used a lot of tech libraries to make this work. I believe all remaining ones exist as node dependencies. Too many to list, but they're all in packages.json.

# Licensing?
I'm not a lawyer, I'm acting on a belief the data itself is licensed under the OGL (See license).

Anything that I have the rights to (presumably some of my code) I'm happy to offer under the MIT license, but I don't want to work out where that line goes.

If anyone from Paizo is looking I hope you don't mind. I believe I'm within the bounds of the OGL & community use licenses. Any request from Paizo regarding the usage of their content (up to and including removing this app) I'll comply with - even if it's not legally binding.
