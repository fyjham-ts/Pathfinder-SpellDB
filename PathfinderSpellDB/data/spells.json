If you and the image are ever farther than 500 feet apart, the spell ends. The image can\u2019t speak, but you can use your actions to speak through the creature, with the spell disguising your voice as appropriate. You might need to attempt a Deception or Performance check to convincingly mimic the creature, as determined by the GM. This is especially likely if you\u2019re trying to imitate a specific person and engage with someone that person knows. In combat, the illusion counts as a creature for flanking. It uses your spell roll for attack rolls and saving throws and your spell DC for its AC. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell is dismissed. The creature has two actions per turn, which it takes when you Concentrate on the Spell. The illusion can\u2019t directly affect the physical world, though its attacks can cause damage by making the target believe they\u2019re real. If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes mental damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. This is a mental effect. The illusion\u2019s Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn\u2019t correspond to the image of the monster\u2014for example, if a Large dragon dealt only 5 damage\u2014 the GM might allow the target to attempt a Perception check to disbelieve the spell as a free action. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not suppress regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion. When a creature disbelieves the illusion, it recovers from half the damage it had taken from it (if any) and doesn\u2019t take any further damage from it. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion." },

Unlike the illusory creature spell, creatures in your scene lack combat abilities and statistics. Your scene doesn\u2019t include changes to the environment around it, though you can place your scene within the illusory environment of a hallucinatory terrain spell. When you create the scene, you can choose to have it be static or follow a program. Though a static scene is stationary, it includes basic natural movement. Wind blowing on an illusory piece of paper would rustle it, for example. A program can be up to 1 minute long, and it repeats when finished. For instance, you could create a programmed scene of two orcs fighting each other, and their fight would go the same way for each repetition. If you create a loop, the two fighters end up in the same place at the start of the fight and at the end of it, but you can smooth the program so it\u2019s hard to tell when the loop ends or begins. However, anyone observing long term almost always notices the program looping. You\u2019re unable to alter the program after you create the illusion.

You can imagine a purpose for each room of the mansion, and the proper accouterments appear within. Any furniture or other mundane fixtures function normally for anyone inside the mansion, but they cease to exist if taken beyond its walls. No fixture created with this spell can create magical effects, but magical devices brought into the mansion function normally. Your mansion contains the same types of foodstuffs and servants as created by the magnificent mansion spell. Each of the mansion\u2019s exterior doorways and windows are protected by alarm spells. You choose whether each alarm is audible or mental as you cast the spell, and each has a different sound (for an audible alarm) or sensation (for a mental one), allowing you to instantly determine which portal has been used. When you prepare spells, you can choose not to recover the spell slot or daily spell you used to cast this spell. If you do, the mansion remains for another 24 hours. The mansion must be created on a plot of land free of other structures. It adapts to the natural terrain, adopting the structural requirements for being built there. The mansion adjusts around small features such as ponds or spires of rock, but can\u2019t be created on water or other nonsolid surfaces. If created on snow, sand dunes, or other soft surfaces with a solid surface underneath, the foundation reaches the solid ground. If created on a solid but unstable surface, such as a swamp or an area plagued by tremors, there\u2019s a 10% chance each day the mansion begins to sink or collapse. The mansion doesn\u2019t harm creatures within the area when it appears, and it can\u2019t be created within a crowd or in a densely populated area. Any creature inadvertently caught inside the mansion when the spell is cast ends up unharmed inside the complete mansion and always has a clear path of escape." }
