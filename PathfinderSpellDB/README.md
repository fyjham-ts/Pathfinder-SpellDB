# Pathfinder SpellDB
This was created for my own personal use - if you have some fun with it that's great!

It is not yet ready for general use - I have uploaded to GitHub early to try and get electron-updating connected.

Spell data originally sourced from [PF2e Spell Finder](https://github.com/spellfinder/spells) plus some additional data I entered to support extra search options. Much respect to the original app, I just wanted a stand-alone offline app. Without his work on the spell data I'd never have made this.

# Licensing?
I'm not a lawyer, I'm acting on a belief the data itself is licensed under the OGL (See license).

Anything that I have the rights to (presumably some of my code) I'm happy to offer under the MIT license, but I don't want to work out where that line goes.

If anyone from Paizo is looking I hope you don't mind. I believe I'm within the bounds of the OGL & community use licenses. Any request from Paizo regarding the usage of their content (up to and including removing this app) I'll comply with - even if it's not legally binding.
